			<h1 id="_idParaDest-199"><a id="_idTextAnchor239"></a>Bonus Chapter - UX Patterns</h1>

			<p>A long time ago, computer software was sold with heavy, printed 
manuals and in many cases, also with specialized training. While some of
 this still applies to corporate applications and specialized hardware, 
such a concept has almost completely disappeared from the consumer 
market. Imagine that, for each website, you had to read a manual and 
attend three months of training classes before even using it. How come, 
today, a user can be presented with a new application and somehow manage
 to accomplish basic tasks at first sight? No doubt, a great contributor
 to this current situation is the years of study and progress in the 
areas of human-computer interactions, a discipline almost as old as <span class="No-Break">computers themselves.</span></p>

			<p>In this chapter, we will take a step back from the intricacies of 
inner-working software patterns and architecture and look at some of the
 well-established patterns for designing a <strong class="bold">user interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">UI</strong>) and <strong class="bold">user experience</strong> (<strong class="bold">UX</strong>). We will do <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>

			<ul>

				<li>Understand the differences between UI <span class="No-Break">and UX</span></li>

				<li>Become familiar with common UX patterns in <span class="No-Break">web applications</span></li>

				<li>Learn about the evil side of UX with <span class="No-Break">dark patterns.</span></li>

			</ul>

			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will have a broad understanding of
 what UX patterns are, the principles they are based on, what the most 
common approaches are today, and the effects they produce for the user, 
be they positive or negative. You will also learn and develop a common 
language to interact with UI and UX designers and <span class="No-Break">other developers.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-200"><a id="_idTextAnchor240"></a>Technical requirements</h1>

			<p>This chapter is mostly informative; however, small examples are 
discussed and implemented in Vue 3, as they demonstrate the use of a 
technique not seen this far in the book. For the complete source code, 
please refer to the project folder for the chapter in the book’s 
repository <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Vue.js-3-Design-Patterns-and-Best-Practices/tree/main/Chapter11"><span class="No-Break">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Vue.js-3-Design-Patterns-and-Best-Practices/tree/main/Chapter11</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-201"><a id="_idTextAnchor241"></a>UI design versus UX design</h1>

			<p>It is common <a id="_idIndexMarker814"></a>to hear these two terms associated or used indistinctively, and<a id="_idIndexMarker815"></a>
 in some cases, both responsibilities are merged into the same role in a
 team, which adds to the confusion. While there is some overlapping, as 
often happens in computer science disciplines, we will focus on the 
differences for <span class="No-Break">learning purposes:</span></p>

			<ul>

				<li><strong class="bold">UI design</strong> is in charge of defining
 the visual language to represent information and capture user input to 
interact with the application. It covers the design of visual styles, 
typography, interactions, colors, sizes, animations, sounds, and so on 
that make up the interface between humans and computers (software and 
hardware). This applies to visual mediums (web, mobile, etc.) as well as
 other types such as natural language interfaces (think of AI assistants
 such as Siri, <span class="No-Break">Alexa, etc.).</span></li>

				<li><strong class="bold">UX design</strong> includes the conditions 
that affect and guide the UI design but encompasses a broader view 
focused on the user’s perception of the system, company, or feature they
 come to interact with. It involves elements beyond software or 
hardware, with aspects such as support, promotion, post-services, and so
 on. The aim is to create a wide and, hopefully, successful positive 
experience from the user’s perspective. Under this definition, it also 
collaborates with other disciplines, such as marketing, customer 
support, distribution, product management, brand recognition, and so on.
 It has the primary objective to alter or create the user’s perception 
that the product, service, or system is easy to use, efficient, and 
above all, useful for <span class="No-Break">their purposes.</span></li>

			</ul>

			<p>Understanding the principles and objectives of each discipline 
will help us develop better software and have a common ground for 
understanding when collaborating with those in these assignments. 
Without UI and UX, even the best-produced software may fall into 
oblivion. Software history is full of examples of companies that went 
the way of the dodo bird, even with superior products to their 
competitors, for neglecting the user experience or having a bad visual 
design. Sometimes, the cover of the book is as important as the 
content...</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-202"><a id="_idTextAnchor242"></a>The principles of UI design</h1>

			<p>At its core, UI<a id="_idIndexMarker816"></a> design has the 
objective of creating an interface that the user finds easy to use, 
efficient, informative, and enjoyable. Marketing concepts such as user 
retention and satisfaction rely heavily on product design. For our 
purposes, we will limit the introduction of UIs to on-display 
application interfaces (presented through a visual medium, such as a 
screen or <span class="No-Break">touch device).</span></p>

			<p>There is ample documentation studying UI design in detail, with 
engineering precision and well-defined industry standards. Each aspect 
has its own set of rules that a good UI designer needs to keep in mind. A
 web designer will see things differently from an industrial designer, 
for example. In our case, most of the patterns for UI design have been 
included since the beginning in the HTML standard, so most, if not all, 
of what we will see as patterns are already familiar to you and the end 
user. How they work, or the principles they follow, however, is not 
something that is commonly discussed or self-evident. For example, why 
is the “X” to close a window in the top-right corner? What does each 
different menu icon mean? Why does the <strong class="bold">Start</strong>
 button appear on the top or bottom-left corner of the screen? Why are 
some features hard to find, while others are accessible at first sight? 
All these questions have a solution rooted in UI design and UX patterns.
 With that in mind, let’s review some of the UI principles, and then 
move on to the <span class="No-Break">UX patterns.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-203"><a id="_idTextAnchor243"></a>Sufficient contrast or distinction between elements</h2>

			<p>This principle <a id="_idIndexMarker817"></a>states that the 
elements of a page should be clearly distinguishable from each other and
 representative of their function. It reflects the need to organize the 
visual elements in a hierarchy using size, colors, typography, margins, 
and white space in such a way that each function is clearly represented 
and distinct from others. The main objective is to direct the user’s 
attention to the focal point of the interface. Let’s see the Packt home 
page (<a href="https://www.packtpub.com/">https://www.packtpub.com/</a>) as <span class="No-Break">an example:</span></p>

			<div>

				<div id="_idContainer081" class="IMG---Figure">

					<img src="Chapter%2011%20Bonus%20Chapter%20-%20UX%20Patterns%20Vue.js%203%20Design%20Patterns%20and%20Best%20Practices_files/Figure_11.01_B18602.jpg" alt="Figure 11.1 – Packt’s home page and color contrast" width="519" height="174">

				</div>

			</div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.1 – Packt’s home page and color contrast</p>

			<p>In this example, most of the content uses a limited number of 
colors (a “palette”), and the two buttons have high contrast, which 
draws the attention of the user: the <strong class="bold">TRY FOR FREE</strong> and <strong class="bold">START LEARNING NOW</strong> buttons. Clearly, the designer has set the focus point for these <span class="No-Break">two actions.</span></p>

			<p>Related to this principle, there is a design “rule” applied in this screenshot that is handy to keep in mind: the <em class="italic">60-30-10 color rule</em>.
 This means that 60% of the section must have a base color (here, it is 
dark brown), 30% is a primary color (used for regular text, menus, and 
the image, which, here, is white), and 10% is reserved for the secondary
 color or high <a id="_idIndexMarker818"></a>contrast (used for the 
focal point, or the “call to action” buttons in orange). Let’s continue 
analyzing this page to see the other principles of <span class="No-Break">UI design.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-204"><a id="_idTextAnchor244"></a>Stimulating repetition and being consistent</h2>

			<p>This principle is based on the concept that people learn through 
repetition. It indicates that the same task, even done through different
 interfaces, should emulate more or less the same repetitive behavior 
from the user. For example, if you ask a user to open a word processor, 
and you ask them to open a file, where will they try to click? Most 
“seasoned” users will take their mouse to the upper-left part of the 
window and look for either an icon that represents “<strong class="bold">Open</strong>,” or the <strong class="bold">File</strong>
 menu. Why is this? It is because this placement has become standard, 
and we have learned through repetition where to find it. If you placed 
the <strong class="bold">File</strong> menu at the bottom right of the screen, most, if not all, of your users would have trouble finding it <span class="No-Break">without direction.</span></p>

			<p>Another example of repetition and consistency appears when 
displaying visual elements – more importantly, when they are part of a 
list or common set. Let’s follow with an example from the Packt <span class="No-Break">Publishing website:</span></p>

			<div>

				<div id="_idContainer082" class="IMG---Figure">

					<img src="Chapter%2011%20Bonus%20Chapter%20-%20UX%20Patterns%20Vue.js%203%20Design%20Patterns%20and%20Best%20Practices_files/Figure_11.02_B18602.jpg" alt="Figure 11.2 – Cards with books" width="1124" height="557">

				</div>

			</div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.2 – Cards with books</p>

			<p>In the preceding example, the designer used repetition to display 
the books in prime time, by using vertical “cards” for each item. Each 
card repeats a similar layout, colors, and format. Once you understand 
what one displays, the same applies to all the others: this is a 
repetition of visual design and is important, so the user doesn’t have 
to “re-learn” the<a id="_idIndexMarker819"></a> interface for <span class="No-Break">each book.</span></p>

			<p>In short, it is the repetition of placements, actions, and visual styles. Let’s move to the <span class="No-Break">next one.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-205"><a id="_idTextAnchor245"></a>Be mindful of alignment and direction</h2>

			<p>The alignment of elements (graphics, fonts, etc.) creates a sense 
of order and organization, showing that such elements belong to the same
 group or have the same weight or importance. We are mostly familiar 
with alignment (and spacing) when working with fonts, but the same 
concept applies to graphical elements such as icons, sections, images, 
and so on. From the previous figure, notice how the tabs are aligned, as
 well as the cards and the content therein. Just by alignment and style 
alone, we can distinguish what belongs to which <span class="No-Break">natural group.</span></p>

			<p>Another example of alignment is clearly seen when only using 
typography for menus and features. For example, in the footer of this 
page, even without the use of icons or visual boundaries, it is easy to 
see what option belongs to each natural group just by using space <span class="No-Break">and alignment:</span></p>

			<div>

				<div id="_idContainer083" class="IMG---Figure">

					<img src="Chapter%2011%20Bonus%20Chapter%20-%20UX%20Patterns%20Vue.js%203%20Design%20Patterns%20and%20Best%20Practices_files/Figure_11.03_B18602.jpg" alt="Figure 11.3 – Packt’s website footer, using alignment to display natural groups" width="480" height="116">

				</div>

			</div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.3 – Packt’s website footer, using alignment to display natural groups</p>

			<p>This example, though simple, already shows the use of contrast 
(bold versus normal font-weight), consistency through repetition, 
alignment, and also the next principle we will see <span class="No-Break">here: proximity.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-206"><a id="_idTextAnchor246"></a>Use proximity and distance to show natural groups</h2>

			<p>This principle is<a id="_idIndexMarker820"></a> simple to follow: 
place the elements that are naturally related close to each other. This 
makes it easier for the user to find and understand. Typography and 
iconography can also be used to show proximity and similar 
functionality. The famous “ribbon bar” introduced by Microsoft in its 
Office applications uses this concept heavily and soon became a 
standard. For example, here is a segment of the <strong class="bold">Home</strong> tab that deals with alignment, lists, spacing, <span class="No-Break">and indentation:</span></p>

			<div>

				<div id="_idContainer084" class="IMG---Figure">

					<img src="Chapter%2011%20Bonus%20Chapter%20-%20UX%20Patterns%20Vue.js%203%20Design%20Patterns%20and%20Best%20Practices_files/Figure_11.04_B18602.jpg" alt="Figure 11.4 – Paragraph icons" width="380" height="98">

				</div>

			</div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.4 – Paragraph icons</p>

			<p>Notice how the icons that modify the type of paragraph, spacing, and alignment are close to each other, without <span class="No-Break">being “mixed.”</span></p>

			<p>These are not the only principles of UI design but are the most 
basic ones that we should keep in mind when developing our components. 
If you work with a team that includes a UI designer, you may receive 
templates or mockups, even storyboards, to implement into Vue 
components, as we saw in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/vue-js-3-design/9781803238074/B18602_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor102"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">User Interface Composition with Components</em>. If instead, you are on a <em class="italic">“one-man band team”</em> and the design of the interfaces falls<a id="_idIndexMarker821"></a> in your lap, these principles will help you greatly to create a professional and useful UI. But there <span class="No-Break">is more...</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-207"><a id="_idTextAnchor247"></a>Laws for UI design</h2>

			<p>Just like we have<a id="_idIndexMarker822"></a> principles, 
several studies have issued or identified “laws” of design, which are 
measurable functions to predict certain software attributes, such as 
usability <span class="No-Break">and friendliness.</span>

In particular, the following <span class="No-Break">stand out.</span></p>

			<h3>Fitt’s law</h3>

			<p>This law specifies <a id="_idIndexMarker823"></a>that the time taken for a user to acquire a target is a function of<a id="_idIndexMarker824"></a>
 the distance from the pointer and the size of the target. The important
 concepts here are the distance and size of the target: the longer the 
distance between targets, the larger these <span class="No-Break">should be.</span></p>

			<p>The application of this law is what places the window close button (<strong class="bold">X</strong>) in one of the corners of the screen (when the window is maximized), the <strong class="bold">Start</strong> button at the lower left of the screen, <em class="italic">Show desktop</em>
 at the bottom right of the screen, and so on. If a user moves the mouse
 in any of these directions, it will sooner or later arrive at these 
targets, and continuing in the same direction will not affect the 
result. In the language of UI design, these buttons are “infinite” as 
once the cursor has reached a corner by the edge of the screen, 
continuing scrolling in the same direction with the mouse will still hit
 <span class="No-Break">the target.</span></p>

			<p>Another implication of this law is that functions that are similar
 should also be placed in proximity to each other (such as the examples 
in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 11</em></span><em class="italic">.4</em>). You can find more information about this law on Wikipedia, <span class="No-Break">at </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%E2%80%99s_law"><span class="No-Break">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts’s_law</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			<h3>Hick’s law</h3>

			<p>This law says that <a id="_idIndexMarker825"></a>the time it takes a user to make a choice is a logarithmic<a id="_idIndexMarker826"></a>
 function based on the number of available options and their complexity.
 In simpler terms, too many options are confusing and will make the user
 take more time to decide. Some implications of this law are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>

			<ul>

				<li>Break complex tasks into smaller groups, manageable by the user to speed up their <span class="No-Break">decision time</span></li>

				<li>Avoid creating interfaces overloaded with options, as they will overwhelm <span class="No-Break">the user</span></li>

				<li>If a function is time-sensitive, minimize the options to the bare minimum for <span class="No-Break">the situation</span></li>

			</ul>

			<p>In everyday software, we can see the application of this law in 
multiple places – for example, in “installers” for a particular 
software, where successive windows with options are presented to the 
user during or before starting the installation in a sequential manner, 
as opposed to a form to fill in. More information about this law can be 
found on <span class="No-Break">Wikipedia: </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law"><span class="No-Break">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			<h3>Ben Schneiderman’s eight rules</h3>

			<p>In 1986, Professor <a id="_idIndexMarker827"></a>Ben Schneiderman published his <a id="_idIndexMarker828"></a>book titled <em class="italic">Designing the User Interface: Strategies for Effective Human-Computer Interaction</em>,
 where he stipulated eight rules for interface design. These rules are 
as relevant today as on the day they were created, so they are worth <span class="No-Break">mentioning here:</span></p>

			<ol>

				<li>Strive for consistency (in actions, steps, <span class="No-Break">placements, etc.).</span></li>

				<li>Enable the use of shortcuts for common tasks (be it using a keyboard <span class="No-Break">or icons).</span></li>

				<li>Offer informative feedback (especially when an <span class="No-Break">error occurs).</span></li>

				<li>Design dialogs with <span class="No-Break">an end.</span></li>

				<li>Offer simple error handling, so the user can take action quickly
 and avoid serious errors by the user. The classical implementation of 
rules <em class="italic">#4</em> and<em class="italic"> #5 </em>are “confirmation dialogs” before performing permanent actions, such as <span class="No-Break">deleting content.</span></li>

				<li>Permit easy reversal of actions (thanks to this, we have <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Z</em></span><span class="No-Break">!).</span></li>

				<li>Support the sense of control in the user. Nothing is worse for a
 user than to feel that the machine is “doing its own thing, out of 
control.” If you ever sent an 800-page file to print by mistake, and it 
took you a dozen pages before you could actually cancel the operation...
 this is what this <span class="No-Break">is about.</span></li>

				<li>Reduce short-term memory. The user can only keep in their 
short-term memory a handful of items and tasks at a time, and too many 
elements on a screen (menu, and so on) create rejection. This principle 
also relates to <span class="No-Break">Hick’s law.</span></li>

			</ol>

			<p>For practical applications and an introduction to the topic, these principles, rules, and laws <a id="_idIndexMarker829"></a>should <a id="_idIndexMarker830"></a>give us a <span class="No-Break">sure footing.</span></p>

			<p>More information about these rules and Ben Schneiderman can be found on <span class="No-Break">Wikipedia (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Shneiderman"><span class="No-Break">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Shneiderman</span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>

			<h3>UX design principles</h3>

			<p>UX design also <a id="_idIndexMarker831"></a>has its own 
objectives and principles that apply to patterns. Above all, the main 
objective of UX is to provide a good perception to the user, to create a
 bond with the brand or product, by carefully tailoring a flow of 
interactions. In this case, the solutions must be <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>

			<ul>

				<li><em class="italic">Useful and usable:</em> First and foremost, the application must do what it intended to do, do it well, and be easy for the user <span class="No-Break">to use</span></li>

				<li><em class="italic">Learnable and memorable</em>: The user must be able to learn and understand what information is presented and internalize it for future use <span class="No-Break">as well</span></li>

				<li><em class="italic">Credible and give control to the user</em>: 
When the user interacts with the application, it must feel that it is 
doing what the user intends and that the result is “safe” for <span class="No-Break">the user</span></li>

			</ul>

			<p>This last principle is very important. If the user feels that the 
application somewhere during the interaction has “lost control” of what 
is going on, it is a recipe for disaster. Sadly, this occurs all too 
often with the dark patterns that we will see later in this chapter, but
 now, let’s see some good patterns that result in a good experience for <span class="No-Break">the user.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-208"><a id="_idTextAnchor248"></a>Common patterns for data manipulation</h1>

			<p>These patterns are<a id="_idIndexMarker832"></a> often matched by 
pure HTML elements, while others have emerged in recent years through 
the clever use of styling of such elements. These have become standard 
in the industry and are well understood by users at first sight. What 
follows here is a non-exclusive list with a short description of when to
 use <span class="No-Break">each one.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-209"><a id="_idTextAnchor249"></a>HTML input elements</h2>

			<p>The standard <a id="_idIndexMarker833"></a>input fields provided 
by HTML are a clear pattern for receiving input from the user. Nowadays,
 the input element has many variants due to the <strong class="source-inline">type</strong>
 attribute, allowing for input other than plain text. Used in forms and 
validation libraries, these elements are as good as they come, ready to 
read and format from text and numbers to URL, date, time, images, and 
colors. The full list of available types supported by today’s browsers 
can be found <span class="No-Break">here: </span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input#input_types"><span class="No-Break">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input#input_types</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			<p>For the most part, these elements are used with basic functionality and some heavy CSS styling. Use <strong class="source-inline">inputs</strong> (and <strong class="source-inline">textareas</strong>)
 any time that you need the user to enter text information. Browsers 
today offer native-looking widgets for the more complex types, such as 
date and <span class="No-Break">color pickers.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-210"><a id="_idTextAnchor250"></a>Checkboxes, radios, and toggle switches</h2>

			<p>Checkboxes <a id="_idIndexMarker834"></a>and<a id="_idIndexMarker835"></a> radio <a id="_idIndexMarker836"></a>buttons are provided natively by HTML and are presented to the user following the format of the local OS or <a id="_idIndexMarker837"></a>environment. <strong class="bold">Checkboxes</strong> represent multiple options to the user, which they can select freely from the group. In contrast, <strong class="bold">radio</strong> buttons <a id="_idIndexMarker838"></a>only allow the selection of one option from <span class="No-Break">the list:</span></p>

			<div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.5 – Checkboxes on the left, and radio buttons on the right</p>

			<p>With the release of the original iPhone, a new variant of the checkbox became very popular: the <strong class="bold">toggle switch</strong>. It is <a id="_idIndexMarker839"></a>not
 provided natively by the HTML standard, but it is easily styled through
 CSS to “disguise” a checkbox. A toggle switch has two states, enabled <a id="_idIndexMarker840"></a>and<a id="_idIndexMarker841"></a> disabled, and<a id="_idIndexMarker842"></a>
 it is often used to activate or deactivate a function or feature. This 
is an important distinction as the checkbox should focus on options or 
alternatives. Here is <span class="No-Break">an example:</span></p>

			<div>

				<div id="_idContainer086" class="IMG---Figure">

					<img src="Chapter%2011%20Bonus%20Chapter%20-%20UX%20Patterns%20Vue.js%203%20Design%20Patterns%20and%20Best%20Practices_files/Figure_11.06_B18602.jpg" alt="Figure 11.6 – Toggle switches in each state" width="606" height="103">

				</div>

			</div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.6 – Toggle switches in each state</p>

			<p>The toggle switch is in an “off” state (or false) when the toggle 
is to the left, and “on” when to the right. Often, switching also 
affects the color, showing it in a mute scale of gray when off or in 
vibrant colors when activated. Internally, these two states are often 
represented by <strong class="source-inline">true</strong> (on) and <strong class="source-inline">false</strong> (off), and they should be used to activate or deactivate settings, features, and so on. You can find the <strong class="source-inline">Toggle</strong> component that implements the styling and the <strong class="source-inline">v-model</strong> code in the repository for <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-211"><a id="_idTextAnchor251"></a>Chips, pills, or tags</h2>

			<p>This pattern<a id="_idIndexMarker843"></a> encompasses<a id="_idIndexMarker844"></a> short<a id="_idIndexMarker845"></a> text (or “copy” in UI lingo) inside<a id="_idIndexMarker846"></a> a<a id="_idIndexMarker847"></a> round box. The copy can be <a id="_idIndexMarker848"></a>accompanied by an icon to emphasize the state when selected, or an action such as an “<strong class="bold">X</strong>”
 symbol to remove it. Usually, pills are used in lists to display 
attributes, tags, categories, or other types of qualificatives for a 
given item. In some cases, they can be used also to select (toggle) 
items from the list. In this case, they rival or behave just like a 
checkbox but in a more visually pleasing manner. The implementation of 
chips is rather trivial and can be done with plain CSS in a single HTML 
element (for example, a <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">span</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> element).</span></p>

			<p>This is a short list of UI patterns to capture user input, but it does cover the most common types: the HTML inputs and <span class="No-Break">styling variations.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-212"><a id="_idTextAnchor252"></a>Common patterns for data visualization</h1>

			<p>These patterns<a id="_idIndexMarker849"></a> display information 
back to the user, either in response to a user action or an application 
event. What follows is a non-exclusive list <span class="No-Break">of patterns.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-213"><a id="_idTextAnchor253"></a>Tooltips</h2>

			<p>This pattern<a id="_idIndexMarker850"></a> shows<a id="_idIndexMarker851"></a>
 the user some floating small text with information regarding the target
 element, usually when the user activates the element using some action 
(a hover, click, selection, etc.). The information is displayed above, 
below, or to the side of the element in the form of a “speech bubble” 
(like in comic books). Here is <span class="No-Break">an example:</span></p>

			<div>

				<div id="_idContainer088" class="IMG---Figure">

			</div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.8 – A tooltip displaying the name/action of the icon and a shortcut</p>

			<p>This pattern is mostly used to display help regarding the target 
object, but it can be used also to display contextual menus. For 
example, selecting a word from this paragraph in a text editor online 
will display a popup with <span class="No-Break">a menu:</span></p>

			<div>

				<div id="_idContainer089" class="IMG---Figure">

					<img src="Chapter%2011%20Bonus%20Chapter%20-%20UX%20Patterns%20Vue.js%203%20Design%20Patterns%20and%20Best%20Practices_files/Figure_11.09_B18602.jpg" alt="Figure 11.9 – A tooltip pattern used to display a contextual menu" width="546" height="117">

				</div>

			</div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.9 – A tooltip pattern used to display a contextual menu</p>

			<p>There may be some discussion regarding whether this last use is a 
tooltip or a contextual menu, but the fact that it opens on selection 
would indicate the first. Traditionally, contextual menus <a id="_idIndexMarker852"></a>are opened with a secondary<a id="_idIndexMarker853"></a>
 action, such as the right mouse button (in Windows and Linux). In 
either case, the concept to remember for this pattern is to show 
information to the user on selection or pre-activation to help them 
decide what to <span class="No-Break">do next.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-214"><a id="_idTextAnchor254"></a>Notification dots, bubbles, marks, or badges</h2>

			<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker854"></a>pattern <a id="_idIndexMarker855"></a>consists<a id="_idIndexMarker856"></a> of <a id="_idIndexMarker857"></a>displaying a <a id="_idIndexMarker858"></a>small <a id="_idIndexMarker859"></a>icon<a id="_idIndexMarker860"></a> on <a id="_idIndexMarker861"></a>top
 of a larger icon to indicate that an event has happened and requires 
the attention of the user, yet it is not urgent. This small icon can be a
 dot, a bubble, and so on. If the notification has a number in it, it is
 also called a <strong class="bold">badge.</strong> Some examples of this pattern are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>

			<ul>

				<li>The small circle with a number for new emails received in the <span class="No-Break">email icon</span></li>

				<li>The double checkmark in a chat application indicating that the other party has received and read <span class="No-Break">the message</span></li>

				<li>A small mark in a taskbar showing that an application has <span class="No-Break">been opened</span></li>

			</ul>

			<p>The key <a id="_idIndexMarker862"></a>concept<a id="_idIndexMarker863"></a> is to<a id="_idIndexMarker864"></a> use<a id="_idIndexMarker865"></a> some sort <a id="_idIndexMarker866"></a>of <a id="_idIndexMarker867"></a>small <a id="_idIndexMarker868"></a>variance to the icon to<a id="_idIndexMarker869"></a> indicate the need for future attention, but it is not urgent and won’t affect the current activity for <span class="No-Break">the user.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-215"><a id="_idTextAnchor255"></a>Toast notifications</h2>

			<p>This pattern is <a id="_idIndexMarker870"></a>used in multiple applications <a id="_idIndexMarker871"></a>and
 OSes. It consists of displaying, for a short amount of time, an 
overlayed floating window with quick information for the user. Often, it
 includes a short text fragment paired with a sensible icon. Depending 
on the OS, this can be displayed natively at the top center, right of 
the screen, or at the bottom right above the system tray. Web 
applications can either implement their own toast notification within 
the browser window or require permission from the user and display a 
“native toast notification” using the local OS. Here is an example of a <span class="No-Break">toast notification:</span></p>

			<div>

				<div id="_idContainer090" class="IMG---Figure">

					<img src="Chapter%2011%20Bonus%20Chapter%20-%20UX%20Patterns%20Vue.js%203%20Design%20Patterns%20and%20Best%20Practices_files/Figure_11.10_B18602.jpg" alt="Figure 11.10 – A native toast notification on the desktop" width="524" height="121">

				</div>

			</div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.10 – A native toast notification on the desktop</p>

			<p>These notifications are useful to inform the user of changes in 
the environment that require their attention, to report back the result 
of an asynchronous operation (success, error, etc.), and so on. These 
calls to attention are ephemeral, so they should not be a critical part 
of an important workflow, except for the conditions <span class="No-Break">just mentioned.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-216"><a id="_idTextAnchor256"></a>Carousel or image sliders</h2>

			<p>Carousel or image<a id="_idIndexMarker872"></a> sliders are a pattern<a id="_idIndexMarker873"></a>
 for displaying, in the same space, different sections with images and 
content in sequential order. Usually, using a timer, these sections are 
presented to the user a few seconds apart, also offering the option to 
skip to any of them through dotted navigation. While they were very 
popular some years ago, there are counterpoints to the use of these, as 
“impatient” users may never see the entire content of a carousel. In 
practice, the recommendation is to keep the list of sections as short as
 possible, somewhere between three to <span class="No-Break">five elements.</span></p>

			<p>Examples of this implementation abound on the internet, as they 
are implemented primarily on the landing page of a site. Practically all
 shopping and news websites make use of this pattern – for example, the 
Amazon landing <span class="No-Break">page (</span><a href="http://www.amazon.de/"><span class="No-Break">www.amazon.de</span></a><span class="No-Break">):</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.12 – Amazon makes good use of image sliders to display items to the user</p>

			<p>While trivial to implement, the use of carousels and image sliders
 is a good way to display information to the user. There is a warning, 
though, that abusing this pattern could lead to an overwhelming and 
saturated experience, create confusion, and even trigger undesirable 
side<a id="_idIndexMarker874"></a> effects, such as sensory <a id="_idIndexMarker875"></a>overwhelming and <span class="No-Break">content avoidance.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-217"><a id="_idTextAnchor257"></a>Progress bars and spinners</h2>

			<p>A progress<a id="_idIndexMarker876"></a> bar is <a id="_idIndexMarker877"></a>any element that gives the <a id="_idIndexMarker878"></a>user <a id="_idIndexMarker879"></a>an
 idea of how far down the workflow the current state of a process is. 
While the name seems to indicate a “bar,” in practice, any element that 
displays progress through a limited number of actions falls into this 
category. The basic objective is to notify the user of the progress of 
tasks that take a long time and show that the system is “busy” working 
on them, thus providing visibility and a sense of control to the user. 
Progress bars are very important to prevent involuntary negative actions
 from the user. If a long-running task is being executed in the 
background (let’s say in a web worker) without any feedback on the 
progress, the user may believe that the task has not started, has 
failed, or the computer has “hung up.” It is a negative user experience 
to leave the user wondering what is going on. Here are some examples of 
progress <span class="No-Break">bar elements:</span></p>

				<div id="_idContainer093" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>

			</div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.13 – Example of progress bars</p>

			<p>In addition to styling, progress bars can also be used in an 
“undetermined state,” meaning that it is not possible for the 
application to calculate how much time or how many steps a process may 
take; however, it still wants to inform the user that the system is busy
 and shouldn’t be interrupted. The HTML standard does provide an element
 specifically for progress bars that can manage these situations (the 
progress element; see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/progress">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/progress</a>), but there are other patterns to use in these cases, such <span class="No-Break">as </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">spinners</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			<p>As the name “spinner” indicates, this is an icon that “spins” on 
itself, giving the notion that the application is busy and working. Here
 is an example of a spinner with a <span class="No-Break">text indicator:</span></p>

			<div>

				<div id="_idContainer094" class="IMG---Figure">

					<img src="Chapter%2011%20Bonus%20Chapter%20-%20UX%20Patterns%20Vue.js%203%20Design%20Patterns%20and%20Best%20Practices_files/Figure_11.14_B18602.jpg" alt="Figure 11.14 – Spinner circle, indicating the application is busy" width="497" height="102">

				</div>

			</div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.14 – Spinner circle, indicating the application is busy</p>

			<p>This approach has been used in OSes and applications for some time
 now, so users understand its meaning. There is one caveat when using 
this pattern and that is that after a long period of time, it can create
 anxiety, so it is recommended to accompany it with some sort <a id="_idIndexMarker880"></a>of<a id="_idIndexMarker881"></a> indicator <a id="_idIndexMarker882"></a>of action. Implementing<a id="_idIndexMarker883"></a> a <strong class="source-inline">spinner</strong> component in Vue is rather trivial, and <span class="No-Break">mostly CSS:</span></p>

			<p class="SC---Heading" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">./components/Spinner.vue</p>

			<div data-testid="custom pre block" class="orm-ChapterReader-codeSnippetContainer"><pre class="source-code">

&lt;script setup&gt;

const $props=defineProps(['caption'])

&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;template&gt;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div&gt;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;span class="<strong class="bold">spinner</strong>"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; {{ <strong class="bold">$props.caption</strong> }}

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;style scoped&gt;

.spinner{

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;display: inline-block;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;height: 1rem; width: 1rem;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;border: 2px solid;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vertical-align: middle;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;border-radius: 50%;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;border-top-color: #06c9c9;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animation: rotate 1s linear infinite;

}

@keyframes rotate {

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0%{ transform: rotate(0deg);}

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100%{transform: rotate(360deg);}

}

&lt;/style&gt;</pre><div class="orm-ChapterReader-snippetButtonContainer"></div></div>

			<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker884"></a>simple <a id="_idIndexMarker885"></a>component, we only need to define a prop for the text, and a class for our<a id="_idIndexMarker886"></a> spinning<a id="_idIndexMarker887"></a> elements. The circle is made here by setting the border radius and defining a color for one border, so the spinning action <span class="No-Break">is noticeable.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-218"><a id="_idTextAnchor258"></a>Pagination and infinite scroller</h2>

			<p>When we need<a id="_idIndexMarker888"></a> to display a long list of items to the <a id="_idIndexMarker889"></a>user, there are two patterns that <a id="_idIndexMarker890"></a>come to<a id="_idIndexMarker891"></a> mind as a well-understood solution: pagination and <span class="No-Break">infinite scrollers.</span></p>

			<p>In <strong class="bold">pagination</strong>, the dataset is divided into smaller parts of fixed size in sequential order. Each subset is called a <strong class="bold">page</strong> and is <a id="_idIndexMarker892"></a>referenced
 by an ordinal (usually a number). This allows for easy navigation 
between pages, such as random and sequential access by the page number. 
Also, giving the same order function in the data allows a quick and easy
 way to “come back” to the data in different sessions. The element that 
allows the user to navigate in the paged data is usually referred<a id="_idIndexMarker893"></a> to as a <strong class="bold">pager</strong>, and it is common practice to place it at the top and bottom of the item list. A typical pager might look <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>

			<div>

				<div id="_idContainer095" class="IMG---Figure">

					<img src="Chapter%2011%20Bonus%20Chapter%20-%20UX%20Patterns%20Vue.js%203%20Design%20Patterns%20and%20Best%20Practices_files/Figure_11.15_B18602.jpg" alt="Figure 11.15 – The elements of a typical pager" width="713" height="188">

				</div>

			</div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.15 – The elements of a typical pager</p>

			<p>In the preceding figure, you can see the different elements of a 
typical pager, usually used for tables or lists of content. However, 
this is not the only shape that a pager may take. It could, for example,
 use a drop-down menu for the page numbers, display ranges of pages, and
 <a id="_idIndexMarker894"></a>so<a id="_idIndexMarker895"></a> on. The <a id="_idIndexMarker896"></a>important concept of this pattern is the division of the set<a id="_idIndexMarker897"></a> and the quick navigation to each <span class="No-Break">individual subgroup.</span></p>

			<p>An alternative to pagination is to use an <strong class="bold">infinite scroller</strong>.
 In this pattern, the exact location of each item in the dataset may or 
may not be needed, and the items are presented to the user as they 
scroll the web page. When the user reaches the end of the list, new 
items are loaded on the page, chunk by chunk, until the user stops 
scrolling or the entire dataset has been loaded. Here is a graphical 
representation of <span class="No-Break">this pattern:</span></p>

			<div>

				<div id="_idContainer096" class="IMG---Figure">

			</div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.16 – The implementation of an infinite scroller</p>

			<p>A number of <a id="_idIndexMarker898"></a>techniques<a id="_idIndexMarker899"></a> are <a id="_idIndexMarker900"></a>used to detect user behavior and load or pre-load<a id="_idIndexMarker901"></a> data. One of the easiest implementations is through the use<a id="_idIndexMarker902"></a> of an <strong class="bold">intersection observer</strong>,
 a native element provided by browsers in JavaScript that triggers an 
event when such an observer intersects with other elements and, in this 
case, with the viewport. Since this is a new concept, we will implement a
 minimal infinite scroller that will look <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.17 – The example infinite scroller limited to a <strong class="source-inline">div</strong> element</p>

			<p>If you scroll down on the <strong class="source-inline">div</strong>
 boundary, by any available means (mouse, keyboard, etc.), the list will
 generate new items and will never stop, giving the impression that the 
scrolling <a id="_idIndexMarker903"></a>is <a id="_idIndexMarker904"></a>infinite. Here<a id="_idIndexMarker905"></a> is the<a id="_idIndexMarker906"></a> source code for <span class="No-Break">that component:</span></p>

import { ref, onMounted } from "vue"

const _max_value = ref(30),&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#1

<strong class="bold">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;observer = new IntersectionObserver(triggerEvent)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="bold">#3</strong>

onMounted(() =&gt; {

<strong class="bold">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;observer.observe(_scroll_watcher.value)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="bold">#4</strong>

})

function <strong class="bold">triggerEvent</strong>() {_max_value.value += 20;}

&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;template&gt;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div v-for="elem in _max_value" :key="elem"&gt;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item {{ elem }}

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong class="bold">ref="_scroll_watcher"</strong>&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#5

&lt;/template&gt;</pre><div class="orm-ChapterReader-snippetButtonContainer"></div></div>

			<p>The preceding component is minimal, but it does illustrate the 
technique. We will have a list of numbers with an initial limit that 
will trigger an overflow in the container (<strong class="source-inline">#1</strong>). This is important as, on the first load, the user will know that there is a scrollbar and more content below (as in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 11</em></span><em class="italic">.17</em>). Now, the technique here is to define a reactive variable, <strong class="source-inline">_scroll_watcher</strong>, pointing to <strong class="source-inline">null</strong>. This variable will later have the value of an element at the bottom of the list, which we mark as a reference (<strong class="source-inline">#5</strong>). We use <strong class="source-inline">null</strong> so Vue does not run any optimization at this point. In line <strong class="source-inline">#3</strong>, we create a new <strong class="source-inline">IntersectionObserver</strong>, and pass as value the reference to our <strong class="source-inline">triggerEvent</strong> function, where we will simply increment the boundary of our list. In our template, we use a <strong class="source-inline">v-for</strong>
 directive to generate the elements for each integer in the list, which 
should appear before our scroll watcher element. The magic happens in 
line <strong class="source-inline">#4</strong>, once our component has been created and mounted into the page. At this moment, Vue has already assigned to <strong class="source-inline">_scroll_watcher</strong> the reference for the HTML element, so we can pass it to our instance of <strong class="source-inline">IntersectionObserver</strong>. As we are using it with defaults, it will run the <strong class="source-inline">triggerEvent</strong>
 function each time the div in question appears in the viewport, which 
will happen when we reach the end of the list. In that function, we 
increment again the number of items, making Vue inject more elements 
into the web page and pushing the scroll watcher div again out of the 
viewport. This process repeats <em class="italic">ad infinitum</em>, giving us a simple but effective <span class="No-Break">infinite scroller.</span></p>

			<p>Beyond the<a id="_idIndexMarker907"></a> implementation<a id="_idIndexMarker908"></a> of the UX pattern, this technique is the correct approach <a id="_idIndexMarker909"></a>to<a id="_idIndexMarker910"></a> binding a reactive variable to an element in the DOM, and it saves us from writing direct JavaScript DOM manipulation, such as <strong class="source-inline">document.getElementById("#someId")</strong> and dealing with issues such as ID collisions. Vue resolves this <span class="No-Break">for us.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-219"><a id="_idTextAnchor259"></a>Common patterns for interaction and navigation</h1>

			<p>These patterns <a id="_idIndexMarker911"></a>control the 
interaction or offer the user options to control the process and 
navigation of the application. As usually happens, some of these 
patterns could also fit into <span class="No-Break">other categories.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-220"><a id="_idTextAnchor260"></a>Placement of menus</h2>

			<p>The placement<a id="_idIndexMarker912"></a> of menus is also a pattern that <a id="_idIndexMarker913"></a>has been standardized in three <span class="No-Break">basic layouts:</span></p>

			<ul>

				<li><strong class="bold">Menu bars</strong> (horizontal) are often placed in a “sticky” position at the top of the screen (meaning they will not scroll with <span class="No-Break">the page).</span></li>

				<li><strong class="bold">Navigation bars</strong> (horizontal), 
mostly popular for mobile devices, are an iconography menu placed at the
 bottom of the screen to navigate to different sections of <span class="No-Break">the application.</span></li>

				<li><strong class="bold">Sidebars</strong> cover the full height of 
the screen, and with variable widths. These show menus with icons and/or
 text. In mobile and desktop applications where the screen’s real state 
is important, there is usually an option to toggle it in or out of the 
viewport. The standard icon to trigger this feature has become the 
“hamburger” icon (see later in <span class="No-Break">this chapter).</span></li>

			</ul>

			<p>Following these standard placements for desktop and mobile will 
ensure that the user knows how to navigate the site easily. Often, some 
applications such as video games break these standards, but unless there
 is a powerful reason to do so, it should <span class="No-Break">be avoided.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-221"><a id="_idTextAnchor261"></a>Breadcrumbs</h2>

			<p>Breadcrumbs<a id="_idIndexMarker914"></a> are a hierarchical list of<a id="_idIndexMarker915"></a>
 links that show the current position of the web page in the overall 
website organization. Each link allows the user to go back to a level, 
without having to use the browser’s <strong class="bold">Back</strong> 
button or dig deep into the main menu. The current approach is to place 
breadcrumbs at the top of the page, before the main content. Here is an 
example of a <span class="No-Break">breadcrumb path:</span></p>

			<div data-testid="custom pre block" class="orm-ChapterReader-codeSnippetContainer"><pre class="source-code">

Home &gt; Level 1 &gt; Level 2 &gt; Level 3 &gt; Current page</pre><div class="orm-ChapterReader-snippetButtonContainer"></div></div>

			<p>The convention is to use the more-than symbol (<strong class="source-inline">&gt;</strong>)
 to separate each navigation page, but there are many artistic licenses 
taken on this matter. Another representation for this navigation is to 
use a tree structure, such <span class="No-Break">as this:</span></p>

			<div data-testid="custom pre block" class="orm-ChapterReader-codeSnippetContainer"><pre class="source-code">

Home

&nbsp;&nbsp;└── Level 1

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── Level 2

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── Level 3

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── Current Page</pre><div class="orm-ChapterReader-snippetButtonContainer"></div></div>

			<p>This “folder-like” structure is not so common for main navigations but is mostly used for nested content<a id="_idIndexMarker916"></a> such as comments <a id="_idIndexMarker917"></a>and replies <span class="No-Break">in forums.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-222"><a id="_idTextAnchor262"></a>Modal dialogs</h2>

			<p>A modal dialog is a<a id="_idIndexMarker918"></a> small window<a id="_idIndexMarker919"></a>
 that opens in front of the application, taking full control of the 
focus. It prevents the user from interacting with the rest of the 
application until the activity presented in the dialog is resolved. 
Modal dialogs should focus on one action only and provide sufficient 
information for the user to take action by giving clear options. Here is
 <span class="No-Break">an example:</span></p>

			<div>

				<div id="_idContainer098" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p>Other than the<a id="_idIndexMarker920"></a> plain copy (text) naming <a id="_idIndexMarker921"></a>convention
 for menu items, there are a number of icons used today to show the user
 at first glance what kind of interaction to expect when presenting a 
menu. Here are some of the standard icons you can find and <span class="No-Break">use today:</span></p>

			<div>

				<div id="_idContainer099" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>

			</div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.19 – Menu icons</p>

			<p>And here are <span class="No-Break">their descriptions:</span></p>

			<ul>

				<li><strong class="bold">Hamburger icon</strong> (three horizontal lines): Reserved for <em class="italic">main menus</em> and navigation, this <a id="_idIndexMarker922"></a>toggles the display of a wide site menu in a sidebar. These types of sidebars that show and hide on convenience <a id="_idIndexMarker923"></a>are called <strong class="bold">drawers</strong> and are very popular in mobile sites <span class="No-Break">and applications.</span></li>

				<li><strong class="bold">Kebab icon</strong> (three vertical dots): Made<a id="_idIndexMarker924"></a> popular by Google’s Material Design, this indicates that there are more <em class="italic">options</em> for the current element or activity and that they will be displayed in a <span class="No-Break">modal dialog.</span></li>

				<li><strong class="bold">Meatball icon</strong> (three horizontal dots): This is<a id="_idIndexMarker925"></a> displayed next to an item on a list and indicates that there is a pop-up menu with additional <em class="italic">actions</em> for <span class="No-Break">the element.</span></li>

				<li><strong class="bold">Bento icon</strong> (9 squares in a 3x3 grid): This is <a id="_idIndexMarker926"></a>used to indicate a pop-up menu to navigate between different <em class="italic">applications</em> inside the same solution <span class="No-Break">or environment.</span></li>

				<li><strong class="bold">Döner icon</strong> (three stack lines <a id="_idIndexMarker927"></a>with different sizes): This indicates options to <em class="italic">sort</em> the entries of a list using a selectable order option (usually in a popup). This icon, however, has <a id="_idIndexMarker928"></a>not become as popular as <span class="No-Break">the others.</span></li>

			</ul>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-224"><a id="_idTextAnchor264"></a>Accordion menus</h2>

			<p>This<a id="_idIndexMarker929"></a> pattern’s basic use is to group <a id="_idIndexMarker930"></a>content
 under a title and to display it only when the user selects it, allowing
 only one group to be displayed at a time. Nowadays, it is used commonly
 for <em class="italic">Frequently Asked Questions</em> pages, and in sidebar menus. Here is an example from the Packt <span class="No-Break">website (</span><a href="https://www.packtpub.com/"><span class="No-Break">https://www.packtpub.com/</span></a><span class="No-Break">):</span></p>

				</div>

			</div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.20 – Accordion menu used for FAQ</p>

			<p>The accordion menu is a pattern well understood by users, and one rather simple <span class="No-Break">to implement.</span>

It helps keep the design clean and allows the user to focus only on what matters <span class="No-Break">to them.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-225"><a id="_idTextAnchor265"></a>Mega menus</h2>

			<p>Thus far, most <a id="_idIndexMarker931"></a>of the patterns we<a id="_idIndexMarker932"></a>
 have seen have the objective of hiding complexity from the user to 
avoid overwhelming them. However, this pattern seems to break this rule 
at first sight. When the complexity of navigation would make the 
features hard to find (for example, more than three levels of depth: 
group -&gt; subgroup -&gt; sub-subgroup), an alternative is to use a <strong class="bold">mega menu</strong>.
 This pattern is commonly used in government websites and other complex 
organizations with heavy unavoidable content. The basic concept is to 
present a large menu containing all (or most) of the options to choose 
from. This doesn’t mean that there will not be a “drilling down” after 
reaching these sections, but it does make access faster. For example, 
let’s see the official website for the city of Hyvinkää, <span class="No-Break">Finland (</span><a href="http://www.hyvinkaa.fi/"><span class="No-Break">www.hyvinkaa.fi</span></a><span class="No-Break">):</span></p>

			<div>

				<div id="_idContainer101" class="IMG---Figure">

					<img src="Chapter%2011%20Bonus%20Chapter%20-%20UX%20Patterns%20Vue.js%203%20Design%20Patterns%20and%20Best%20Practices_files/Figure_11.21_B18602.jpg" alt="" width="1216" height="565">

				</div>

			</div>

			<p class="IMG---Figure">Figure11.21: Hyvinkää city home page mega menu</p>

			<p>As you can see, it is a compelling number of options with just one
 click in the top menu. However, notice how well organized they are and 
visually separated from each other. The mega <a id="_idIndexMarker933"></a>menu <a id="_idIndexMarker934"></a>pattern breaks the <em class="italic">simplicity</em>
 rule but does not forget other rules and principles of UI design, 
making it still pleasing to the eye. In other cases, it is also possible
 to consider the mega menu as a placeholder for other patterns, such as a
 sidebar or accordion menu. The official Packt website (<a href="https://www.packtpub.com/">https://www.packtpub.com/</a>) uses this pattern in the main menu <strong class="bold">BOOKS &amp; </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">VIDEOS</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> option:</span></p>

			<div>

				<div id="_idContainer102" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.22 – Packt mega menu with a sidebar to categorize and filter options</p>

			<p>A mega menu could be a place for innovation as it is easier for the user to understand and use. It is <a id="_idIndexMarker935"></a>not a viable option for every <a id="_idIndexMarker936"></a>web
 application but can be very powerful when properly used. When there is 
no other option than to show a large number of shortcuts or options, 
this is a good pattern to keep <span class="No-Break">in mind.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-226"><a id="_idTextAnchor266"></a>Drop-down menus</h2>

			<p>Drop-down<a id="_idIndexMarker937"></a> menus and selection <a id="_idIndexMarker938"></a>boxes
 display a list of options to the user when they are activated (by a 
click or touch, for example) through a trigger area (icon, text, or 
button). Here, the concept of hiding the options and showing them upon 
“request” by the user is more important than a specific implementation. 
The accordion and mega menus make use of this concept, for example. The 
accordion menu could be considered a list of drop-down menus and is not 
that far off. HTML provides a native solution for selection lists (the <strong class="source-inline">select</strong> element), but the same concept can be applied in many circumstances and, with some creativity, can birth <span class="No-Break">new implementations.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-227"><a id="_idTextAnchor267"></a>Common patterns for content organization</h1>

			<p>The patterns we <a id="_idIndexMarker939"></a>will see next have to do with the overall organization and layout of the website <span class="No-Break">or application.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-228"><a id="_idTextAnchor268"></a>Responsive applications</h2>

			<p>The term <em class="italic">responsive</em> relates <a id="_idIndexMarker940"></a>to the <a id="_idIndexMarker941"></a>way
 the layout of an application adapts to the size of the screen. Perhaps 
you have heard of the “mobile-first approach,” which is a philosophy to 
design first for smaller screens, and then move upward to the possible 
resolutions to reach the desktop, which is considered the largest. While
 there are ways to accomplish this with JavaScript, the most sensible 
direct approach is to use well-thought-out designs with CSS <span class="No-Break">media queries.</span></p>

			<p>Depending on the application, there are certain formulas to create
 a responsive site, but analyzing the many alternatives goes beyond the 
objectives of this book. Instead, we will see only one as an example, 
using the “switch columns” method. This method basically sets for mobile
 (or narrow portrait screens) the main content inside a single vertical 
column, section by section. A main navigation bar or menu is placed at 
the top or bottom of the screen, always visible. Then, for the desktop, 
the navigation bar totally or partially moves to the top menu or to a 
sidebar, and the content from the main column moves to horizontal 
sections, stacked one after the other. This method is illustrated and 
better understood with <span class="No-Break">this figure:</span></p>

			<div>

				<div id="_idContainer103" class="IMG---Figure">

					<img src="Chapter%2011%20Bonus%20Chapter%20-%20UX%20Patterns%20Vue.js%203%20Design%20Patterns%20and%20Best%20Practices_files/Figure_11.23_B18602.jpg" alt="Figure 11.23 – Transformation from mobile first to desktop" width="529" height="291">

				</div>

			</div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.23 – Transformation from mobile first to desktop</p>

			<p>As you can see from the preceding figure, the sections are always 
in the same order, but the content inside adapts from a vertical to 
horizontal layout direction. This concept is so simple and clean to 
design that it has become the standard for most landing pages. Once you 
understand this pattern, you begin to see it everywhere it <span class="No-Break">is implemented.</span></p>

			<p>A simple coding approach to do this change is by using the CSS 
flexbox model and changing the orientation from column to horizontal at 
the section level. Here is <span class="No-Break">an example:</span></p>

			<div data-testid="custom pre block" class="orm-ChapterReader-codeSnippetContainer"><pre class="source-code">

// For mobile

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@media only screen and (<strong class="bold">max-width: 600px</strong>) {

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;section{

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;display: flex;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flex-direction: column;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}

// For desktop

section{

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;display: flex;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flex-direction: row;

}</pre><div class="orm-ChapterReader-snippetButtonContainer"></div></div>

			<p>Notice how the <a id="_idIndexMarker942"></a>code has included a<a id="_idIndexMarker943"></a> breakpoint at 600-px wide. You can control different screen sizes by applying multiple media queries <span class="No-Break">with breakpoints.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-229"><a id="_idTextAnchor269"></a>Home link</h2>

			<p>This pattern is so <a id="_idIndexMarker944"></a>ubiquitous that we do not even<a id="_idIndexMarker945"></a>
 think about it. The main corporate logo is placed at the top left of 
the page, as a link to the home screen. The position is not random, and 
it has its origins in the way users “scan” a page. Different users will 
take a quick look when a page loads, guiding the eyes in a <em class="italic">Z</em>, <em class="italic">L</em>,or <em class="italic">T</em>
 movement through the page. Placing the logo as a link at the top left 
ensures that it is the first item the user will register. In this 
chapter, <em class="italic">Figures 11.21</em> and <em class="italic">11</em><em class="italic">.22</em> are good examples of this pattern. But there are exceptions to the placement, such as Google’s <span class="No-Break">home page:</span></p>

				<div id="_idContainer105" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p>The home link<a id="_idIndexMarker946"></a> pattern should bring you back to either <a id="_idIndexMarker947"></a>the
 home page or the first step of the process. This pattern is so 
widespread and understood by users, that any exception should be made 
very carefully with a good understanding of the behavior and interaction
 of the <span class="No-Break">user base.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-230"><a id="_idTextAnchor270"></a>Hero section, call to action, and social media icons</h2>

			<p>The <strong class="bold">hero section</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker948"></a>the <a id="_idIndexMarker949"></a>first <a id="_idIndexMarker950"></a>part that <a id="_idIndexMarker951"></a>displays
 when the page loads in the browser and goes from the very top (where 
the home link and main menu reside) to, at most, the visible bottom of 
the screen. All content below this section is referred to as “below the 
fold,” meaning that to see it, the user needs to scroll down the page. 
The hero section is considered the most important part of the home page,
 and the place where the<a id="_idIndexMarker952"></a> initial <strong class="bold">call to action</strong> is placed. We<a id="_idIndexMarker953"></a>
 visited this concept previously in this chapter when talking about UI 
design principles and contrast. Nowadays, most websites will adhere to 
this pattern and display the hero section in contrast, with large images
 or a carousel, and a predominant call <span class="No-Break">to action.</span></p>

			<div>

				<div id="_idContainer106" class="IMG---Figure">

					<img src="Chapter%2011%20Bonus%20Chapter%20-%20UX%20Patterns%20Vue.js%203%20Design%20Patterns%20and%20Best%20Practices_files/Figure_11.26_B18602.jpg" alt="Figure 11.26 – Kobold Press home page’s hero section – colorful and direct" width="480" height="184">

			</div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.26 – Kobold Press home page’s hero section – colorful and direct</p>

			<p>In the preceding example from Kobold Press (<a href="https://koboldpress.com/">https://koboldpress.com/</a>),
 we can see how they have applied several patterns seen here, from the 
home link and main menu to the hero section and the call to action. 
Notice also, on the left side, the display of social <a id="_idIndexMarker954"></a>media <a id="_idIndexMarker955"></a>icons <a id="_idIndexMarker956"></a>as
 a floating sidebar. It is becoming a pattern to place such icons with 
links to the social media address for each institution, or in the case 
of posts or articles, a link to “share” the content. Common places to 
locate the social icon’s bar are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>

			<ul>

				<li>In the footer of <span class="No-Break">the website</span></li>

				<li>At the beginning and/or end of <span class="No-Break">an article</span></li>

				<li>In the description of <span class="No-Break">a product</span></li>

			</ul>

			<p>When including links to share direct content from a Vue 
application (for example, a product from an online store), it is 
important that the link and the Vue application point directly to such 
an item. Careful attention needs to be placed on the way the navigation 
URL is formed and interpreted on the first load by the Vue application, 
to avoid sharing links that will<a id="_idIndexMarker957"></a> open <a id="_idIndexMarker958"></a>the<a id="_idIndexMarker959"></a> home screen instead of the desired section of <span class="No-Break">the application.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-231"><a id="_idTextAnchor271"></a>Other patterns</h2>

			<p>There are other patterns, hundreds<a id="_idIndexMarker960"></a> 
if not thousands, that have a direct influence on the user experience. I
 encourage you to continue investigating these, such as <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>

			<ul>

				<li>Shopping <span class="No-Break">cart patterns</span></li>

				<li><span class="No-Break">User onboarding</span></li>

				<li><span class="No-Break">Gamification patterns</span></li>

				<li>Registration and <span class="No-Break">de-registration patterns</span></li>

			</ul>

			<p>There is, however, a dark side to user experience, and it has to 
do with the use of manipulative and deceitful practices. As an ethical 
developer, you should avoid using any of these <span class="No-Break">dark patterns.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-232"><a id="_idTextAnchor272"></a>Dark patterns</h1>

			<p>Dark patterns are<a id="_idIndexMarker961"></a> carefully designed
 interfaces and interactions with the sole purpose of manipulating or 
tricking the user into performing unintended actions or even entangling 
them into malicious results. After such a definition, you may think that
 such actions belong to the deepest shady corners of the internet. 
Sadly, even mainstream companies often follow these unethical practices.
 As a matter of fact, the reproduced examples in these sections all 
belong to such a category, and as often happens with design patterns, 
many of these overlaps or can be found nested within each other. Let’s 
see them one <span class="No-Break">by one.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-233"><a id="_idTextAnchor273"></a>Trick questions</h2>

			<p>This pattern is<a id="_idIndexMarker962"></a> a simple or complex play on words to trick the user to do the opposite of what their intention is. Here is <span class="No-Break">an example:</span></p>

			<div>

				<div id="_idContainer107" class="IMG---Figure">

					<img src="Chapter%2011%20Bonus%20Chapter%20-%20UX%20Patterns%20Vue.js%203%20Design%20Patterns%20and%20Best%20Practices_files/Figure_11.27_B18602.jpg" alt="Figure 11.27 – A trick question for a newsletter subscription" width="663" height="100">

				</div>

			</div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.27 – A trick question for a newsletter subscription</p>

			<p>As you can see in this example, a user filling in a form would be 
tempted to leave this checkbox unchecked if they don’t want to receive a
 newsletter from the company. The common tendency is to pay attention to
 the marked text in bold, which is a sort of title. The real action for 
the checkbox can be found at the end of the paragraph, which the 
majority of users would not read: <strong class="bold">Check this option if you do not want to receive </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">our newsletter</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-234"><a id="_idTextAnchor274"></a>Sneak into the basket</h2>

			<p>This dark<a id="_idIndexMarker963"></a> pattern appears in many 
shopping applications, quite commonly in services such as hosting and 
airline tickets. It consists of placing items into the shopping cart at 
checkout, but that the user has not selected, usually presented as an 
offer or a “necessary” item of a small amount. Here is <span class="No-Break">an example:</span></p>

			<div>

				<div id="_idContainer108" class="IMG---Figure">

					<img src="Chapter%2011%20Bonus%20Chapter%20-%20UX%20Patterns%20Vue.js%203%20Design%20Patterns%20and%20Best%20Practices_files/Figure_11.28_B18602.jpg" alt="Figure 11.28 – An additional item has been added to the shopping cart" width="682" height="104">

				</div>

			</div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.28 – An additional item has been added to the shopping cart</p>

			<p>In this example, after ordering for a new domain, a new item, <strong class="bold">First time setup</strong>,
 has been automatically added to the shopping cart. This item does not 
have any other explanation, and the amount appears to be “small” in 
comparison to the main purpose of the purchase. Often, these types of 
items are “scammish” and have no other intent than to add penny by penny
 to the final amount. In some cases, there may be options to remove such
 items<a id="_idIndexMarker964"></a> before confirming the purchase, but quite often there <span class="No-Break">are none.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-235"><a id="_idTextAnchor275"></a>Roach motels</h2>

			<p>This pattern <a id="_idIndexMarker965"></a>appears quite often for
 services and subscriptions. It consists of making a very easy purchase,
 often after a free trial period, with the condition that charges will 
continue until explicitly canceled by the user. Here is where the dark 
pattern appears: by making this “unsubscribe” process complicated or 
impossible to complete. For example, some companies require that the 
user contact the support team with a signed letter accompanied by a 
legal ID. The basic concept is to “trap” the user so rescinding the 
contracted service becomes <span class="No-Break">near impossible.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-236"><a id="_idTextAnchor276"></a>Privacy Zuckering</h2>

			<p>This dark pattern<a id="_idIndexMarker966"></a> is named after the
 founder of a recognizable social media company. It consists of offering
 to the user a large number of services, for free, while the use of the 
applications monitors the user’s activity and behavior. This data is 
then collected and sold behind the scenes to third-party companies 
without the knowledge of the user. Often, this practice is somehow named
 in a rather lengthy contract of terms of service, which the user needs 
to accept before using the services. This way, the company alleges that 
the user has given their consent and is aware, while very few users ever
 read or interpret properly such <span class="No-Break">an agreement.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-237"><a id="_idTextAnchor277"></a>Preventing price comparison</h2>

			<p>In this pattern, the <a id="_idIndexMarker967"></a>website 
presents to the user a number of plans for services, but purposely hides
 or disguises either features or individual prices, so the user is 
unable to make a direct comparison to select the most <span class="No-Break">suitable option.</span></p>

			<p>The price is hidden or disguised in such a way that the user 
cannot make an informed decision and must select an option based on 
features or <span class="No-Break">other attributes.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-238"><a id="_idTextAnchor278"></a>Misdirection</h2>

			<p>This is another <a id="_idIndexMarker968"></a>pattern often used 
in shopping cart workflows. It consists of using names and options that 
are confusing to the user, with pre-selected options that hide 
alternatives and better price deals. If the system has a floating price 
value (for example, for hotels or airplane tickets), this pattern is 
often used to manipulate the user into selecting the option that is in 
the best interest of <span class="No-Break">the company.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-239"><a id="_idTextAnchor279"></a>Hidden costs</h2>

			<p>In this pattern, the <a id="_idIndexMarker969"></a>user’s 
selection of products or services does not disclose a total or 
comprehensive description of the associated costs involved (beyond 
taxes). Either in the initial purchase or subsequent purchases, the 
total amount paid results in a higher price than what the user estimated
 in the <span class="No-Break">first instance.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-240"><a id="_idTextAnchor280"></a>Bait and switch</h2>

			<p>This pattern is<a id="_idIndexMarker970"></a> widely used by 
online advertisers and is one that causes the most hate in captive 
users. It simply disguises one option to perform another or the exact 
opposite the user intended. A classic example is when a pop-up window 
displays a <strong class="bold">Close</strong> button (usually a simple <strong class="bold">X</strong>), but when the user clicks it intending to close the dialog window, it opens a new tab with the <span class="No-Break">advertised website.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-241"><a id="_idTextAnchor281"></a>Confirm shaming</h2>

			<p>A highly <a id="_idIndexMarker971"></a>manipulative pattern, it 
involves deliberately using wording or actions to shame and ridicule the
 user into doing something they didn’t want at the beginning of the 
transaction. It can go from mildly annoying to outspoken insulting. It 
is often used together with other dark patterns. Here is <span class="No-Break">an example:</span></p>

			</div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.29 – A confirmation dialog when removing a service from the cart</p>

			<p>Notice in the example how the wording in the action buttons is 
highly manipulative, even though the original question is not so. This 
pattern is a double-edged sword, as users may feel the<a id="_idIndexMarker972"></a> rejection of the entire service and cancel the <span class="No-Break">entire operation.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-242"><a id="_idTextAnchor282"></a>Disguised ads</h2>

			<p>When an <a id="_idIndexMarker973"></a>advertisement is injected 
into a page, it can disguise itself as proper content, imitating styles 
and action buttons with the intent of tricking the user to trigger a 
redirection or download a file. In some cases, the camouflage is such 
that it is not possible to distinguish the site’s call to action and the
 advertisements. This pattern is popular on free sites that offer to 
host files for download, where it is common to find multiple <strong class="bold">Download</strong>
 buttons on the page, yet only one does actually download the desired 
file and the others redirect the user to a third-party site. Here is <span class="No-Break">one example:</span></p>

			<div>

				<div id="_idContainer110" class="IMG---Figure">

					<img src="Chapter%2011%20Bonus%20Chapter%20-%20UX%20Patterns%20Vue.js%203%20Design%20Patterns%20and%20Best%20Practices_files/Figure_11.30_B18602.jpg" alt="Figure 11.30 – FileHippo.com hosts free software. Some ads disguise as Download buttons" width="1176" height="356">

				</div>

			</div>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.30 – FileHippo.com hosts free software. Some ads disguise as Download buttons</p>

			<p>In this screenshot from <a href="http://filehippo.com/">FileHippo.com</a>, if you access the download page for VLC Media Player, the site presents multiple <strong class="bold">Download</strong> buttons. If a user does not pay attention, it may trigger a different action than the intended <span class="No-Break">software download.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-243"><a id="_idTextAnchor283"></a>Friendly spam</h2>

			<p>In this dark <a id="_idIndexMarker974"></a>pattern, the 
application requests access to the user’s contacts, with the idea of 
expanding their network or social circle. If the user accepts, their 
entire contact list will be “spammed” with emails as if coming from the 
user, offering the service. Often, once this information has been 
shared, it is also shared with third-party entities <span class="No-Break">and advertisers.</span></p>

			<p>The list of dark patterns may not be directly associated with a single media or framework, but it is the <a id="_idIndexMarker975"></a>ethical responsibility of people in this industry to avoid or <span class="No-Break">prevent them.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-244"><a id="_idTextAnchor284"></a>Summary</h1>

			<p>In this chapter, we saw important patterns to present the user with a satisfactory <span class="No-Break">user experience.</span>

We also learned important terms to speak with designers in equal terms 
and with mutual understanding – a necessary point for collaboration and 
presenting the user base with the best possible positive experience. We 
also reviewed some of the most common dark patterns, which are 
techniques and workflow implementations to manipulate users and often 
deprive them of privacy and resources. While mostly informative, this 
chapter should give you a better understanding of the environment where 
web applications are built, and what standards to follow for easy use. 
This is all knowledge that a good engineer and developer should be <span class="No-Break">aware of.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-245"><a id="_idTextAnchor285"></a>Review questions</h1>

			<p>Here are some simple questions to help you summarize what you learned in <span class="No-Break">this chapter:</span></p>

			<ul>

				<li>What are UI and <span class="No-Break">UX patterns?</span></li>

				<li>Can you name the benefits of using <span class="No-Break">UX patterns?</span></li>

				<li>How can you benefit of using standard patterns in your Vue <span class="No-Break">3 components?</span></li>

				<li>What are dark patterns and why should they <span class="No-Break">be avoided?</span></li>
