# Objectives 

1. Scaffold a simple out-of-the-box SPA application for a specific task in a few minutes, with the possibility of further styling and filling it with content.
2. Fine-tune the application using small functional code blocks.
3. Collect and generalize the best techniques and practices for creating a modern reactive Vue application.
4. Enable novice developers to familiarize themselves with the Vue.js ecosystem with ready-made examples, learn front-end and Vue 3 best practices, from building application architecture to naming CSS classes.
5. Enable experienced developers to quickly and efficiently build the framework of a finished web application and leverage reusable code blocks (boilerplate), especially those that cannot be distributed as NPM packages.

This application should act as a website wireframe builder, with the ability to choose when scaffolding:
- A global business website template (portfolio, blog, online store, etc.)
- Variations of the general layout of the web application
- Specific component options (header, footer, navigation drawer, etc.)
- General style/design options
- Specific functionality injected as functional fragments (API module, i18n, PWA, splash screen, Auth module, themes, etc.)
- GitHub actions options with the ability to build and deploy to popular hosting solutions
- Ability to connect/integrate popular libraries (including UI) if needed
- Possibility to integrate with certain headless CRM and API services

Separately, it is planned to create a web showcase, where the user, dynamically changing the parameters, will be able to view and test the available site layouts, themes/styling, components (header, footer, etc.) and functionality of future application, as well as their combination with each other.
